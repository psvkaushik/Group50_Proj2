# Troubleshooting tips:

Following are few tips we learnt as worked through this project:

1. If you run the setup.sh or windows_setup.bat file, it gives you an environment which is ready with requirements installed for the application to run.
   However, before running the script, you need to make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed in your system orelse the script might throw some error
2. [Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) make sure your token is not expired.
3. Make sure you have proper internet connection
